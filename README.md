Planning: Some Samples and Ideas how to control motion effects with MCU and Smartphones (Experimental, Not Finished)

This project is an exploration of the possibilities of remotely controlling actuators using inexpensive microcontrollers. The ideas are meant to give magicians simple ways to trigger movements of objects on stage using microcontrollers, smartphones, and smartwatches.

All of this could, of course, also be achieved with a regular off-the-shelf remote control from a model hobby store. However, I want to go a step further and take advantage of the availability of simple microcontrollers such as the ESP32 family to provide some practical guidance.

I am particularly interested in seeing how far one can get using ready-made components. The basic idea arose when I discovered the Motion Module from M5Stack.

* 4 servo outputs
* 2 motor control outputs

...and the possibility to connect additional components via the bus system.

This project is by no means finished. It is a proof of concept.

If there’s something useful for you in it, feel free to take it. 

Feedback is welcome.
